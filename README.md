# Portfolio with Next.js

- *This is still work-in-progress!*
- *Image coming soon!*

## This FrontEnd Built With
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Why make this?
- To showcase a few projects, offer my resume, and have a place for folks to contact me.  

- As a front end developer, I enjoy making projects with new technologies to continue learning about software development.  This project allowed me to play around with **Next.js**, which is a tool ive been meaning to try out recently, and has been a real joy to work with!  In this case, SSG made sense given I only have HTML and a few images im serving to the client.  

- This project both updated my previous portfolio site, and challenged me to learn more development technologies.

## How do I see it?
